UBC Data Science Assignment 7 Repo

This is the repository for the seventh assignment of the UBC course introduction to the data science toolbox. It comprises a .gitignore file, which ignores unnecessary files for committing and pushing. It also has two jupyter notebooks in which the answers for questions 11 and 12 are respectively displayed. Finally, the repository also contains an HTML version of question 12 as asked for in question 12.
